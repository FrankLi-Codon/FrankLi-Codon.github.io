#### **Analysis of providers charges and payment for Medicare inpatient services.**

  The United State's health insurance system is infamously byzantine, where the charges of procedures and drugs appears to be wildly disproportionate to the actual cost in settlement bills. In this repo, I explore the relationship between hospital/provider charge practices and the settlement payment with Medicare. 
  The dataset come from the Inpatient Utilization and Payment Public Use File, 2015. I fetched longitude/latitude coordinates for each provider from API and mapped out the aggregate charge/settlement data. I also employed regression to see if there are any geographic patterns of spending and explore cost/settlement patterns for different categories of procedures.
